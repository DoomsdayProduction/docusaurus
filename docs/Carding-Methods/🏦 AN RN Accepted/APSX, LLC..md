## Guide/Instructional
  I personally was attempting to smack a 3d printer from this site but the payment was declined. After so many hours - - I received a email from one of their staff members informing me as to why my order was declined and then offered to send a custom invoice for me.
  This then allowed me to use a AN/RN (With the available funds) to pay the invoice.

> [!danger]- USE SAME NAME FOR PAYMENT
> When you pay with the AN/RN as I did - - They will ask for you the Bank Institute Name of the AN/RN and the Account Holders Name - - Make sure the Account Holders Name / Delivery Address Name / Billing Address Name - - ALL MATCH
