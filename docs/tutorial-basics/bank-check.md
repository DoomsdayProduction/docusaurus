# Carding: An Introduction

**Carding is a serious crime that involves the illegal use of credit card information without the cardholder's authorization.**

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

* **What it is:** Carders obtain credit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes (Card Verification Value) through various illicit means. They then use this stolen information to make unauthorized purchases online or in-person.

* **How it's done:**
    * **Data Breaches:** Cybercriminals infiltrate businesses and steal massive amounts of customer data, including credit card information.
    * **Phishing:** Fraudsters send deceptive emails or messages that trick individuals into revealing their personal and financial information.
    * **Skimming:** Physical devices are attached to ATMs or point-of-sale terminals to capture card data when a card is swiped.
    * **Keylogging:** Malicious software records keystrokes on a victim's computer, capturing login credentials and other sensitive information.
