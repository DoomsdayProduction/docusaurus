**Interactive Voice Response (IVR) API Access**
IVR Is something relatively new to the scene but if you have experience with OTP Bots, similar concept - expect calling the phone banking voice system rather then the victim.


Give it CC|SSN or CC|ZIP (depending on bank) and it will call the bank and enter the details then recording the balances and transcription them back to you for known balance and status checking.
