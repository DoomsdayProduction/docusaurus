## OpenBullet

OpenBullet is an open-source web testing suite that allows users to perform various tasks related to penetration testing, data scraping, and automation. It features a modular design, enabling customization for different testing needs. Users can create complex configurations using a "stacker" that supports conditional logic and various modules for handling requests, parsing data, and managing proxies

**File Types:**

- **Config Files:** These are essential for defining how OpenBullet interacts with target websites. They can be customized to include various parameters for testing.
- **Wordlists:** These files contain lists of usernames and passwords used in brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.
- **Database Files:** OpenBullet uses LiteDB to store information about proxies, hits, and records

## OpenBullet 2

OpenBullet 2 is an updated version of the original tool, designed with improved features for both developers and malicious actors. It is particularly noted for its capabilities in executing credential stuffing attacks by mimicking legitimate user behavior to evade detection

File Types:**

- **.opk Files:** These are ZIP archives containing configuration settings and scripts necessary for running tests.
- **Loliscript (.Loli):** A scripting language used within OpenBullet 2 to automate tasks like sending HTTP requests and parsing responses

## SilverBullet

SilverBullet is another tool used for web testing and automation, similar to OpenBullet but with a focus on ease of use and streamlined processes. It allows users to manage proxies, run tests, and analyze results efficiently.**File Types:**

- **Configuration Files:** Similar to OpenBullet, SilverBullet uses config files to define test parameters.
- **Log Files:** These files record the outcomes of tests run through SilverBullet, helping users analyze performance.

## SilverBullet Pro

SilverBullet Pro offers enhanced features over the standard SilverBullet version. It includes advanced analytics tools and additional modules for more complex testing scenarios. This version is often aimed at professional users who require more robust capabilities.**File Types:**

- **Pro Config Files:** These files contain advanced settings tailored for professional use cases.
- **Analytics Reports:** Generated during tests, these reports provide insights into performance metrics.

## Cookie Bullet

Cookie Bullet focuses specifically on managing cookies during web interactions. It is designed to facilitate automated sessions by handling cookie storage and management seamlessly.**File Types:**

- **Cookie Files:** These files store session cookies used in automated web requests.
- **Session Configs:** Similar to other tools, these configurations dictate how Cookie Bullet interacts with target websites regarding cookie handling.
