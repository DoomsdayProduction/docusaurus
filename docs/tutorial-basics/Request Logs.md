**ðŸ›€ Request Logs** feature will allow each member to give a specific request for a high valued target or a priority target that the staff will hunt down, validate, and then fulfill your request daily.


**Hypothetical "Weak Targets"**

* **Outdated Systems:** Businesses with outdated software, operating systems, or security protocols might have vulnerabilities that could be exploited to steal credit card data. 
* **Poorly Secured Websites:** Websites with weak encryption (less than SSL/TLS), missing security certificates, or outdated security plugins could be more susceptible to data breaches.
* **E-commerce Platforms with Insufficient Security:** Some e-commerce platforms might have inherent security weaknesses or require businesses to implement their own security measures, which could leave some stores vulnerable.
* **Businesses with Limited Security Training:** Employees with limited security training might be more likely to fall victim to phishing attacks or social engineering tactics.

**Hypothetical "Reliable Targets"**

* **High-Value Targets:** Businesses that handle large volumes of financial transactions (e.g., major retailers, airlines, financial institutions) might be seen as more valuable targets by cybercriminals.
* **Industries with Sensitive Data:** Healthcare providers, financial institutions, and government agencies often handle highly sensitive personal information, including credit card data.
