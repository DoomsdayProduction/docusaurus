    <summary>üì± Applications Data</summary>
    <p>You can find various üìÇ application folders such as folders named "Plugins," "Applications," "Extensions," or "Games." These folders may contain data related to popular applications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Steam:</strong> Digital distribution platform for video games, which may store user credentials and game data.</li>
      <li><strong>Telegram:</strong> Messaging app that can store chat histories and user authentication tokens.</li>
      <li><strong>Discord:</strong> Communication platform for gamers that may include user settings and conversation logs.</li>

### **Putting Stealer Logs to Use**

Once you have analyzed the stealer log contents, you can put the acquired data to various uses:

**a. Identity Theft:**

- Use the stolen login credentials and session data to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Impersonate victims and engage in identity theft.

**b. Financial Fraud:**

- Access banking accounts or e-commerce platforms to transfer funds or make fraudulent purchases using the stolen data.

**c. Cryptojacking:**

**e. Data Brokerage:**

- Sell the acquired data on dark web markets or cybercriminal forums to generate profit.

## Staying Safe and Responsible

While engaging with stolen data can be lucrative for cybercriminals, it is essential to consider the risks and ethical implications involved:

- Avoid detectable IP addresses: Use secure connections and reliable VPN services to mask your online identity and avoid detection.
- Be mindful of legal consequences: Engaging with stolen data without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Be aware of the potential legal consequences of your actions.
- Respect victims' privacy: Avoid using stolen data for malicious purposes that directly harm or exploit victims.
- Practice responsible disclosure: If you uncover critical vulnerabilities or sensitive data during your analysis, consider responsibly disclosing the findings to affected parties or relevant organizations.
